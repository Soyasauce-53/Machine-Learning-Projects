# Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository is a portfolio of my machine learning projects. It showcases a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning models, from classic algorithms like linear regression and K-means clustering to more advanced deep learning architectures. Each project is designed to solve a specific problem and includes well-documented code, along with insights into the data analysis, model training, and evaluation processes.
